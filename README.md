# RBM_mixed_state_tomography
Tomography using the NQS ansatz and a procedure of step-wise extraction of pure eigenstates of the in-general mixed states 

A short description of the files:

mainForPsi1 is the main file that is to be run to extract the first eigenstate. Similarly for mainForPsi2.

rhoRBM is the class file for the RBMs/NQS. It contains all the functionality of the RBMs/NQS.

tomoHelper has helper functions to generate random density matrices for testing or to generate random POVMs/Unitaries etc.

plotter is used to plot the results of the main file run.
